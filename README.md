# JS-DayCalendar
Week 5 challenge, day calendar
I used Jquery, Bootstrap and DayJS (and its advanced format) to build this.

NEED:
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


I hit all the marks, I also went a bit beyond the ask, I added the ordinal characters to the date (using advanced formats from dayJS), I had dig a bit to figure out how to implement it in my script, more than I anticipated spending on it, but that's the way.
I also added a dynamic time on the page below the date. I tried to figure out how to dynamically change the block status using that dynamic time, but couldn't make it work.
